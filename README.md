Hi there
Hi! 👋

My name is Nikita, I am a frontend developer.

I believe that through thorns you can break through to the stars, so each project is not just a task for me, but a step towards mastery. From the layout of landing pages to working with the API, I get pumped through practice.

🛠️ My stack:

Basic: React, JavaScript, SCSS, HTML5

Tools: Git, Figma, Vite, npm

📍 Now: Ready for real-world tasks and commercial projects

I am looking for a team or orders where I can grow and benefit

Learning more deeply: React, TypeScript.
